# CNCFia

The idea with this board is to provide a *generic* shield/daughter card for 3.3V MCUs running CNC firmwares like GRBL (and its ports) and g2core. For that, instead of making a shield with specific sockets, we decided to provide a pin header that can be used to connect to different MCUs.

## Included capabilities

### Switches

There are six opto-isolated connectors for limit switches (X, Y, and Z Min/Max limits), a Probe connector and an extra opto-isolated connector to be used for any generic function, and five non-opto isolated ones to be used for external controls (Door security, Emergency Stop, etc).

The opto-isolated switches have an option to be powered by an entirely separated power source to provide full electrical isolation.

All the switches are pulled UP via 4.7kâ„¦ resistors, intended to be used with NC (normally closed) switches connected to the GND, making it an active low signal. Take that in consideration when wiring/configuring the software.

### External driver control/level shifting

Support for nine voltage shifted outputs, mosfet (2n700X) driven. Enough to provide Step/Pulse/Enable signals for three external drivers (those usually have a 5V control voltage).

The mosfets connect the outputs to GND, so when wiring make sure to provide the 5V common wire to all positive (+) signals and the outputs to the negative (-) signals.

## Electrical notes

View this project on [CADLAB.io](https://cadlab.io/project/2459).

All calculations were made considering a 3.3V output from the driving MCU pins, while keeping the output currents under 10 mA, what should be safe for most of the MCUs around.

The 3904s driving the relays have a base current (Ib) of ~ 7.8 mA, that should be enough to saturate the transistor and provide the 78 mA needed by the relay coil.

The LTV-847s are used with typical values for Vf and If, according to datasheet specs.

The OPAMP output for the spindle can be regulated with a potentiometer and from the 3.3V PWM it can get values close to 11V with a 12V power source. Simulated circuit shows a 0.4s approximately time to get to the stable voltage.
